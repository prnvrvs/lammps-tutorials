    "1. Click on Run... \n",
    "1. Enter `cmd` and hit OK \n",
    "1. In new window, change to the directory that contains the LAMMPS executable (lmp_win_no-mpi.exe), the input script (calc_fcc.in), and the potential file (Al99.eam.alloy). For example, if these are on the desktop, type 'cd h:/desktop' to change to the desktop (or wherever these are). \n",
    "1. Type `lmp_serial < calc_fcc.in` \n",
    "1. If the simulation completes, then it will type \"All done!\" Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, what? It didn't work? OK, quick check. Can you actually run the LAMMPS executable?  Find the executable and its path.  Most likely the executable is in a different directory than the input script and the potential file.  So, try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command prompt window, can you type in the location of the LAMMPS executable?  If it's in the same directory that you are in, then it could be as easy as `lmp_serial`.  If not, you can run LAMMPS even when it lies in another directory somewhere, like in `C:/Program\\ Files/LAMMPS\\ 64-bit\\ 20Apr2018/bin/lmp_serial`.  If you click enter and nothing happens, then ... good!  Hit `CTL + C` to exit.  It should tell you the current version, i.e., \"LAMMPS (20 Apr 2018)\".  If it gives you an error, then the path to the executable isn't right, try again.  Remember that if you are using folders with spaces in them, then you need to enter `'\\' + ' '` within the path."

    "`lattice fcc 4 orient x 1 0 0 orient y 0 1 0 orient z 0 0 1`\n",

    "`lattice fcc 4 orient x 1 1 0 orient y -1 1 0 orient z 0 0 1`\n",

    "then you get a simulation cell that is oriented in the $<110>$ directions in the x- and y- directions.  If you mess up on the math, i.e., try 110 and 110 for the x and y directions (without the '-1'), then LAMMPS will return: <br>\n",
    "`ERROR: Lattice orient vectors are not orthogonal`\n",

    "So, if you try the $<110>$-oriented single crystal cell, LAMMPS automatically scales the x- and y-direction periodic lengths to 5.6568542 Angstroms (i.e., $4\\sqrt{2}$).  After minimization, the cohesive energy per atom is `-3.35999998818379` ev, th\n",

    "First, check that the potential file is in the directory that you are running out of. Although, you can insert paths, if you want to store the potentials in another directory. Second, make sure that the potential file name is the same as that given in the input script. For instance, Windows has the habit of saving text files (like the potential files) with .txt extensions. If you happen to be running from a Windows operating system, I would change the settings so that you can see the extensions of the files as well. "
